**STUDENT NAMES:** Marius Klepp , [Navn 2]  
**GROUP:** 50

This project was developed as part of the course IDATx2003 (Programming 2), which is part of the Bachelor's program in Computer Science at NTNU. Millions is a Java-based stock market simulator where players can buy and sell shares, track their portfolio, and compete to grow their net worth over time.

## About the Game

Millions simulates a stock exchange where the player starts with a chosen amount of capital and a set of stocks loaded from a CSV file. Each week, stock prices change randomly, and the player must make smart decisions about when to buy and sell to maximize their net worth.

Key features include:

- Start a new game with a custom name, starting capital, and stock data from any CSV file
- Browse the stock market — search, filter, and view price history and statistics
- Buy and sell shares with real commission and tax calculations
- View all completed transactions with full details and receipts
- Advance to the next trading week, which triggers price updates across all stocks
- Track your net worth and player status (Novice, Investor, Speculator) in real time
- Sell your entire portfolio and exit the game at any time

## Usage

### Starting a New Game

When the application launches, you are taken to the **New Game** screen. Here you must:

1. Enter your player name
2. Enter your starting capital
3. Select a stock data file (CSV format) from your file system

The application will load all stocks from the file and bring you to the main exchange view.

### The Market View

The main screen shows all available stocks on the exchange. You can:

- Search by ticker symbol or company name
- Click a stock to view its price history, highest/lowest price, and weekly change
- See the week's top gainers and losers

### Buying and Selling

To **buy**, select a stock and enter the quantity you wish to purchase. A summary will show you the gross value, commission (0.5%), and total cost before you confirm.

To **sell**, open your portfolio, select a share, and confirm the sale. A receipt showing gross value, commission (1%), capital gains tax (30% on profit), and total payout will be displayed.

### Advancing to the Next Week

Once you are done trading, click **Advance to next week**. All stock prices update randomly. Your portfolio values and net worth update automatically.

### Player Status

Your current status is always visible in the interface:

| Status | Requirement |
|---|---|
| **Novice** | Starting level — no conditions |
| **Investor** | Traded ≥ 10 weeks and net worth increased by ≥ 20% |
| **Speculator** | Traded ≥ 20 weeks and net worth at least doubled |

### Ending the Game

To finish, use the **⋯** menu and select **Sell all & quit**. This sells your entire portfolio and takes you to the end screen, where you can see your final result before closing the application.

## Stock Data File Format

Stock data is loaded from a CSV file with the following format:

```
# Top 500 US Stocks by Market Cap
# Ticker,Name,Price
NVDA,Nvidia,191.27
AAPL,Apple Inc.,276.43
MSFT,Microsoft,404.68
```

- Lines starting with `#` are treated as comments and ignored
- Blank lines are ignored
- Each stock line follows the format: `symbol,name,price`
- Decimal separator is `.` (period)

A sample stock file is included in `src/main/resources/`.

---

## Testing

Run all unit tests with Maven:

```bash
mvn test
```

Unit tests cover the core business logic of the application, including:

- `Stock` and `Share` construction and getters
- `PurchaseCalculator` and `SaleCalculator` (gross, commission, tax, total)
- `Portfolio` — adding, removing, and querying shares
- `TransactionArchive` — storing and retrieving transactions
- `Player` — balance management and net worth calculation
- `Exchange` — buying, selling, stock lookup, and price advancement

Both positive (happy path) and negative (error/edge case) tests are included. Tests follow the **Arrange–Act–Assert** pattern and use JUnit 6.

## Project Structure

```

```

---

## Design Patterns Used

- **MVC (Model–View–Controller):** The GUI is structured strictly according to MVC. Views display data, controllers handle user input, and the model contains all business logic.
- **Observer:** The model is observable. Views register as observers and update automatically when the model changes state (e.g., after a trade or week advance).
- **Factory:** A `TransactionFactory` is used to create `Purchase` and `Sale` instances, decoupling transaction creation from the rest of the code.
- **Strategy / Interface-based calculators:** `TransactionCalculator` is an interface implemented separately by `PurchaseCalculator` and `SaleCalculator`, making it easy to swap or extend calculation logic.
